# Code Labs Academy - ReactJS code files

## About this repository

This repository contains a collection of examples for the Modern Web Development with ReactJS unit of the web development bootcamp offered by [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/). This unit is all about ReactJS, we go from the basic concepts such as JSX, working with components, conditional rendering, to the advanced concepts such state management with Redux Toolkit.

## Concepts covered

In this repository, you can find some files to get started with ReactJS. You don't need to install anything, we are using ReactJS CDN, so just download the files and play with them. Note that this way of using React can be okay for testing purposes, but for production you will need to set up a React environment.
